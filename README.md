# Data_cleaning_in_python(FIFA 2021)

### Introduction

The code and documentation for the FIFA21 dataset's data cleaning process is present in this repository. 
This project aims to clean and enhance the dataset that contains player data from the well-known video game FIFA 21.

### Dataset Overview

The FIFA21 dataset comprises over 18K unique player records, including details like name, age, nationality, club, and overall rating.

### Issues found

Several issues were found during the initial exploration and analysis.
Data Format Issues
• Missing values in Hits and Loan Date End columns.
• Inconsistent formatting across columns.
• Heights and Weights columns have different units.

### Tools Used

For the data cleaning project, the following tools and libraries were used:

1. **Python** for data cleaning.
2. **Pandas** was instrumental in data manipulation, cleaning and handling missing values.
3. **NumPy** for mathematical operations and array handling during the cleaning process.
4. **Jupyter Notebooks** provided an interactive environment for code development, exploration and documentation.

### Data Cleaning Process Overview

• **Data Understanding:** Thorough examination of the dataset to understand its structure, columns, and meanings. 
• **Data Exploration:** Exploratory Data Analysis performed to identify patterns and anomalies.
• **Handling Missing Values:** EDA identified valid reasons for missing values in Hits and Loan Date End columns.
• **Standardizing Formatting:** Resolved inconsistent formatting issues using transformations, lambda functions, and data normalization techniques.
• **Validation and Quality Checks:** The cleaned dataset underwent rigorous validation to ensure data quality, accuracy, and integrity.
